# Project-1---Trivia

Made a simple Finance Trivia. 
Used Objects and arrays to store my questions. 
Used DOM maniplulation to get my questions to post on the website. 

- The game has player 1 and player 2. 

The object of the game is to score the most points in 45 seconds and beat your opponent. 

The user with the most points wins. 

The logic was simple but a stuggle for me.
