Concept:
My game was a simple Finance Trivia for Two players to compete and see who can score the most points in 45 seconds.

Technologies Used:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript


Approach: First created a wireframe to get the Trivia to even work. 
Create a logic to how the game would function. 
Initially it was simple one player game which would keep track of your score and show the result at the end. 
Then getting it to show player 2's result. 




Challenges:
My biggest challenge was everything. I feel like I had to teach myself everything all over again. 

I created a one player game which would restart the game and show your score. 

I had to incorprate the reset bottom to display it has a two player game. 

This was the most challengeing part was to figure out a way to store the variable and have it rerun the game and compare the score. 

Getting a timer to work and show on the game was a big win. 





























Made a simple Finance Trivia. 
Used Objects and arrays to store my questions. 
Used DOM maniplulation to get my questions to post on the website. 

- The game has player 1 and player 2. 

The object of the game is to score the most points in 45 seconds and beat your opponent. 

The user with the most points wins. 

The logic was simple but a stuggle for me.
